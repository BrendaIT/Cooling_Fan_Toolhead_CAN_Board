# Cooling_Fan_Toolhead_CAN_Board
This MOD arises from the need for active cooling on the Toolhead Board CAN for VORON2.4 350 Afterburner with cable chain. When printing ABS or other materials, with the doors closed the Toolhead Board CAN reaches temperatures around 70/80 degrees. In my case the Board went into ERROR_MCU thus stopping the print in progress.
